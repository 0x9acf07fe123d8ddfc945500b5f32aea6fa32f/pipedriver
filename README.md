# Named Pipe Driver

The Named Pipe Driver is a kernel-mode driver that uses named pipes to facilitate communication between usermode and kernelmode. The driver is divided into several files, each of which represents a separate code block, including the driver entry point, the named pipe creation, and the communication methods.

## Driver Entry Point

The driver entry point is the starting point of the driver code. It initializes the driver and registers the driver with the Windows operating system. The entry point also creates the named pipe that will be used for communication between usermode and kernelmode.

## Named Pipe Creation

The named pipe creation code block is responsible for creating the named pipe and setting up its properties. The named pipe is set up to be accessed by a specific user or group, and is given a name that can be used to reference it in usermode.

## Communication Methods

The communication methods are used to enable communication between usermode and kernelmode. The named pipe driver uses named pipes as the communication method, allowing usermode applications to send messages to the kernel driver. The messages are then processed by the driver and appropriate actions are taken.

The use of named pipes in the driver makes it difficult for anti-cheat software, such as BattlEye and EasyAntiCheat, to detect the communication between usermode and kernelmode. This allows the driver to be used in game cheat engines without being detected by anti-cheat software.
